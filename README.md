Except for some work related repos, I utilize the learning wheel inspired by Gardener's theory of Multiple Intelligence to organize the repos. Some topics belong to multiple categories at the same time.

The categories are: 

**Creative**
- Aesthetic
- Music

**Practical**
- Play
- Work

**Well-being**
- Mind & Body
- Relationships

**Academic**
- STEM
- Humanities
